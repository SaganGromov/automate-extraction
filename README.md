# automate-extraction
Suppose you downloaded a folder called The.Bear.S03.1080p.WEB.H264-SUCCESSFULCRAB, which contains ten subfolders, each of which contains .r00 files which, when extracted, give rise to a .mkv file. This script automates the extraction of these .mkv files - it extracts the files with winrar, then it moves each .mkv file to the original folder and afterwards it renames each .mkv file in a nicer pattern.
